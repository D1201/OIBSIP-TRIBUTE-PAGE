                <ul>
                    <li>Mahendra Singh Dhoni ( born 7 July 1981) is an Indian professional cricketer who 
                        was captain of the Indian national cricket team in limited-overs formats from 2007 
                        to 2017 and in Test cricket from 2008 to 2014. He is a right-handed wicket-keeper batsman. 
                        He led the team to three ICC trophies including the 2007 ICC World Twenty20, 2011 ICC Cricket 
                        World Cup and 2013 ICC Champions Trophy.</li>
                    <li>Under his captaincy, India won the Asia Cup two times, in 2010 and 2016. India also won ICC 
                        Test Championship Mace two times in 2010 and 2011 under his leadership. He is considered as 
                        one of the greatest Captains and Wicket Keeper-Batsmen of all time. 
                        Throughout his 15 year long international career, Dhoni has won several awards and accolades.</li>
                    <li>In Indian domestic cricket he played for Bihar and Jharkhand Cricket team. He is the captain 
                        of Chennai Super Kings (CSK) in the Indian Premier League. He captained the side to championships 
                        in the 2010, 2011, 2018 and 2021 editions of IPL league. Also under his captaincy Chennai Super 
                        Kings (CSK) Won Champions League T20 two times, in 2010 and 2014. He vacated the captaincy on 
                        24 March 2022, being replaced by Ravindra Jadeja.[14][15] He took back the captaincy on 30 
                        April 2022.</li>
                    <li>Dhoni made his ODI debut on 23 December 2004, against Bangladesh in Chittagong,[17] and played his first Test a year later against Sri Lanka.[18] He played his first T20I also a year later against South Africa.[19] In 2007, he took over the ODI captaincy from Rahul Dravid.[20] In 2008, he was selected as Test Captain.[21] His captaincy record in this format was mixed, successfully leading India to a series win against New Zealand in 2008 and the Border-Gavaskar Trophy (home series in 2010 and 2013) against Australia while losing to Sri Lanka, Australia, England, and South Africa by big margins in away conditions</li>
                    
                    <li>The Indian ODI team in the early 2000s saw Rahul Dravid as the wicket-keeper to ensure that the wicket-keeper spot didn't lack in batting talent.[67] The team also saw the entry of wicket-keeper/batsmen from the junior ranks, with talents like Parthiv Patel and Dinesh Karthik (both India U-19 captains) named in the Test squads.[67] With Dhoni making a mark in the India A squad, he was picked in the ODI squad for the Bangladesh tour in 2004/05.[68] Dhoni did not have a great start to his ODI career, getting run out for a duck on debut.[69] In spite of an average series against Bangladesh, Dhoni was picked for the Pakistan ODI series. </li>
                    <li>In the second match of the series, Dhoni, in his fifth one-day international, scored 148 in Visakhapatnam off only 123 deliveries. Dhoni's 148 surpassed the earlier record for the highest score by an Indian wicket-keeper, a record that he would re-write before the end of the year</li>
                    <li>Dhoni had few batting opportunities in the first two games of the Sri Lankan bilateral ODI series 
                        (Octoberâ€“November 2005) and was promoted to No. 3 in the third ODI at Sawai Mansingh Stadium 
                        (Jaipur). Sri Lanka had set India a target of 299 after a Kumar Sangakkara century and, in reply, 
                        India lost Tendulkar early. Dhoni was promoted to accelerate the scoring and ended the game with 
                        an unbeaten 183 off 145 balls, winning the game for India. The innings was described in 
                        Wisden Almanack (2006) as 'Uninhibited, yet anything but crude'. The innings set various 
                        records including the highest individual score in ODI cricket in the second innings,[74] a 
                        record only broken after seven years by Shane Watson. Dhoni ended the series with the 
                        highest run aggregate (346) and was awarded the Man of the Series award for his efforts. 
                        In December 2005, Dhoni was rewarded a B-grade contract by the BCCI</li>
